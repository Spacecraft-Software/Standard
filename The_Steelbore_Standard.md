## §1 — Preamble

The Steelbore Standard defines the engineering principles, compliance requirements, and design conventions that govern all software produced under Spacecraft Software. The umbrella encompasses two categories of work: **Steelbore OS** — the operating system and all OS-specific artifacts (configurations, themes, OS tooling) — and **independent Spacecraft Software projects** such as Zamak, Ironway, Ferrocast, and Caliper, which are designed to work with Steelbore OS but are not OS-specific and may run on any compliant platform. Both categories are full citizens of Spacecraft Software and subject to this standard in full. Where a project-specific specification conflicts with this standard, the stricter of the two requirements shall prevail.

**Standard name vs. project naming.** "The Steelbore Standard" is the canonical, stable name of *this standard*. It is independent of the projects it governs and of the umbrella organization name — the standard retains this name regardless of any future renames. The v1.7 umbrella rename (Steelbore → Spacecraft Software) and the v1.8 reinstatement of this standard's name are recorded in the changelog. Versioning of project codenames (see §2) and versioning of the standard are separate concerns.

### Changelog

- **v1.17 (2026-06-08):** Licensing & build overhaul. (1) **Standard relicensed** from `GPL-3.0-or-later` to **`CC-BY-SA-4.0`**, effective this version forward — GPL suits software, not a prose specification; CC BY-SA preserves the share-alike copyleft ethos and is purpose-built for documents. This affects the Standard document itself only; the projects it governs are unchanged by this point. (2) **§4.1:** project license is now `GPL-3.0-or-later` **or** `AGPL-3.0-or-later` (AGPL for network-facing software), prospective with no forced re-license. (3) **§4.2 added:** explicit upstream-license-compliance clause — preserve third-party copyright notices, license texts, and `NOTICE`/`AUTHORS` verbatim; ship upstream licenses in `LICENSES/`. (4) **§4.3:** SPDX/REUSE compliance per <https://reuse.software> — two-tag headers (`SPDX-FileCopyrightText` + `SPDX-License-Identifier`), a `LICENSES/` directory, `.license`/`REUSE.toml` coverage for headerless files (replacing the old "documents are exempt" rule), and `reuse lint` as the CI gate. (5) **§3.2:** explicit optimization-flag exception — flags like LTO that break/destabilize a build on a given toolchain/platform (e.g., NixOS, cross-compilation) MUST be disabled and documented, since Stability (P1) outranks Performance (P2). §5.1/§5.2/§6/§13.2 license references and the §4/§12 compliance-checklist items updated to match.
- **v1.16 (2026-06-08):** §12 reframed — UTC Z is now explicitly the **default and preferred** timezone (not a universal mandate forced onto every domain). New §12.2.1 documents a domain exception: a project whose core domain is fundamentally local-time-bound (e.g., `Mawaqit` prayer-time calculations, sunrise/sunset, local scheduling) may declare local time as its *primary* representation for that domain's data, provided it is documented, the UTC default still governs the project's general-purpose machinery (logs, commits, APIs), and a UTC instant remains derivable via a stored IANA timezone. §12.1 timezone row and §12.3 updated to reference the new exception and avoid contradicting it.
- **v1.15 (2026-06-08):** §2 naming convention expanded — added explicitly endorsed canonical sources: *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, *Hackers* (1995), Spielberg films, *Ghost in the Shell*, *Æon Flux*, *Super 8*, *LOST*, the *Cloverfield* franchise, and robot/android names from any sci-fi film or franchise. §2 now explicitly frames naming as a fun, playful exercise alongside the existing space-machine-AI fitness test.
- **v1.14 (2026-06-03):** §3.2 reframed — Performance is the foremost priority after Stability, and its default means of achievement is **multi-core, multi-thread concurrency** (parallelism as the baseline, designed in from the start), *unless* concurrency would materially degrade performance (overhead, contention, or inherently serial workloads), in which case a documented serial/simpler approach is chosen. §3.2 compliance-checklist bullet revised.
- **v1.13 (2026-06-03):** §3.1 reframed — Priority 1 is now **Stability**, not Memory Safety. Memory safety remains the single most important contributor and primary lever, but Priority 1 now also mandates robust error handling, fault tolerance / graceful degradation, and test-verified stability. Cardinal Rule updated to reference stability (including memory safety); §3.1 compliance-checklist bullet revised.
- **v1.12 (2026-05-25):** §6.3 extended: added explicit authorized signing identity rule — all commits from v1.12 onwards must be signed with the `Mohamed.Hammad@SpacecraftSoftware.org` Ed25519 SSH key; committer email and signing key identity must both resolve to that address. Commits predating this version are exempt.
- **v1.11 (2026-05-24):** Three normative updates: (1) Copyright notices updated to `Copyright (C) 2026 Mohamed Hammad & Spacecraft Software` in all locations. (2) §9.1 added: new apps must expose palette colors through a named `Steelbore` theme rather than hard-coded hex literals, enabling clean theme substitution. (3) §12 revised: UTC Z remains the canonical/mandatory primary format; local time expressed as a UTC offset may now optionally accompany UTC Z values in display, API responses, and stored records.
- **v1.10 (2026-05-20):** Standardized copyright notice to `Copyright (C) 2026 Mohamed Hammad` in all three locations (YAML frontmatter masthead, §13 attribution block, and `--version` / About template in §6).
- **v1.9 (2026-05-18):** Clarified organizational model in §1: "Steelbore" now specifically refers to Steelbore OS and OS-specific artifacts (configurations, themes, tooling); "Spacecraft Software" is the broader umbrella. Independent projects (Zamak, Ironway, Ferrocast, Caliper, etc.) are peer citizens of the umbrella — designed to work with Steelbore OS but OS-agnostic and usable on any compliant platform. Both categories governed by this standard in full.
- **v1.8 (2026-05-18):** Standard name reinstated as "The Steelbore Standard". Primary mandate reaffirmed as the Steelbore OS line; scope explicitly extended by default to all Spacecraft Software projects (unless a project's own spec explicitly carves out an exception). Subtitle updated to reflect dual scope. Source file renamed `The_Spacecraft_Software_Standard.md` → `The_Steelbore_Standard.md`. §13.1: added Standard subdomain entry (`Standard.SpacecraftSoftware.org`). Umbrella org name and domain (Spacecraft Software / SpacecraftSoftware.org) unchanged.
- **v1.7 (2026-05-15):** Umbrella renamed from `Steelbore` to `Spacecraft Software` per the brand consolidation. Standard's name updated to "The Spacecraft Software Standard"; domain to `SpacecraftSoftware.org`; contact email to `Mohamed.Hammad@SpacecraftSoftware.org`; §13.1 subdomain pattern to `<ProjectName>.SpacecraftSoftware.org`. Skill ID prefix renamed (`steelbore-*` → `spacecraft-*`). Subproject codenames unchanged. The OS line (`Steelbore OS`, `Steelbore OS Bravais`, `Steelbore OS Lattice`) retains the Steelbore name and is unaffected by this rename.
- **v1.6 (2026-05-13):** Synced §2.1 development statuses with PROJECTS.md — `Bravais` and `Anvil` and `Flux` promoted to Completed; `Ferrocast` corrected to Planning; `Mawaqit` updated to Planning (Pending rename).
- **v1.5 (2026-05-13):** Corrected `Craton` status in §2.1 from `Active` to `Reserved` — codename is registered but no development has started yet.
- **v1.4 (2026-05-13):** Synced §2.1 Legacy Metallurgical Registry with PROJECTS.md — added five previously unregistered pre-v1.2 codenames: `Anvil`, `Flux`, `Pearlite`, `Ferrite_OS`, and `Forge`. Expanded §13.1 subdomain table to include all first-party projects with GitHub repositories that were missing: Anvil, Construct, Ferrite_OS, Forge, Ginx, Loran, Pearlite.
- **v1.3 (2026-05-12):** Added §6.3 (Signed & Verified Commits — mandatory Ed25519 SSH commit signing with hosting-platform "Verified" status; the rule extends to programmatic, CI, and assistant-driven commits and requires rewrites to preserve signatures). Added §13.3 (Third-Party Attribution — `CREDITS.md` at project/skill root when external work is substantially built upon, distinct from mechanical SPDX license metadata). Two new compliance-checklist bullets cover both additions.
- **v1.2 (2026-05-11):** Replaced §2 metallurgical naming convention with Aerospace, Sci-Fi & AI naming (aerospace/astronomy terminology + franchise references from *2001: A Space Odyssey*, *The Matrix*, *Terminator*). Preserved pre-v1.2 metallurgical-era names under §2's Legacy Registry. Added explicit statement that the standard's name was decoupled from project naming and would survive any project or umbrella rename (subsequently revisited in v1.7's umbrella rename). Renamed `Lattice` to `Bravais` (collision with Lattice OS) in registry and §13.1 subdomain table. Flagged `Mawaqit` as pending rename under the v1.2 convention.
- **v1.1 (2026-05-06):** Added §5 Project Posture (personal-hobby default, general-use carve-out, required posture files). Renumbered prior §5–§13 to §6–§14. Added posture bullet to compliance checklist.
- **v1.0 (2026-03-08):** Initial release.

## §2 — Aerospace, Sci-Fi & AI Naming Convention

All **new** project codenames, module identifiers, and public-facing component names **must** draw from one of the following domains:

- **Real aerospace and astronomy** — orbital mechanics terms, propulsion concepts, named missions/programs, stellar objects and phenomena, observatories.
- **Science-fiction franchises with space / AI / cybernetic themes** — naming is meant to be enjoyable as well as fitting. The following are explicitly endorsed canonical sources:
    - *2001: A Space Odyssey*, *The Matrix*, *Terminator* — the original canonical trio
    - *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* — also a rich vein for in-jokes (Vogon, Marvin, 42, Babel fish, Heart of Gold)
    - *Hackers* (1995)
    - Spielberg films (*Close Encounters of the Third Kind*, *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *A.I. Artificial Intelligence*, *Minority Report*, *Ready Player One*, etc.)
    - *Ghost in the Shell*
    - *Æon Flux*
    - *Super 8*
    - *LOST* (TV series)
    - *Cloverfield* films
    - Robot / android names from any sci-fi film or franchise (e.g., HAL, Data, Bishop, T-800, GERTY, TARS, Marvin)

  Other franchises (e.g., *Alien*, *Blade Runner*, *Ex Machina*) remain acceptable if they fit the space-machine-AI register.
- **Generic sci-fi / AI vocabulary** — hyperspace, neural, cybernetic, synthetic, sentinel, oracle, daemon, vector, lattice (the lowercase common noun), etc.

| Category  | Examples                            | Domain                          |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Projects  | Apollo, Discovery, Skynet, Trinity  | Missions / Ships / AI Machines  |
| Modules   | Apogee, HAL, Cortex, Sentinel       | Subsystems / AI Cores           |
| Utilities | Boost, Throttle, Trace, Telemetry   | Operational Verbs / Telemetry   |
| Releases  | Vega, Pulsar, Quasar, Nebula        | Stellar Phenomena               |

Names must be **fitting for space-related and futuristic AI machines** — the test is whether the name would feel at home on the hull of a spacecraft or in the boot banner of an AI machine. Reject proposed names that don't pass this test.

### §2.1 — Legacy Metallurgical Registry (pre-v1.2)

Projects named before the v1.2 convention drew from metallurgy, materials science, and industrial forging. These names are **preserved as-is** unless explicitly renamed by the maintainer. The v1.2 convention applies prospectively — no forced back-rename.

| Codename    | Status                | Description                                                    |
|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Steelbore` | Renamed to Spacecraft Software (umbrella, v1.7) | Former umbrella organization name. Renamed 2026-05-15 under the v1.7 brand consolidation. The OS line (`Steelbore OS`, `Steelbore OS Bravais`, `Steelbore OS Lattice`) retains the Steelbore name. |
| `Aetheric`  | Active                | Next-generation extensible text editor (Pulsar + Quasar + Nebula IPC). |
| `Zamak`     | Active                | Rust bootloader (Limine rewrite)                               |
| `Bravais`   | Completed (renamed)   | NixOS flake configuration. Renamed from `Lattice` due to collision with Lattice OS. `Bravais` is still a metallurgical-era name (Bravais lattice) and predates the v1.2 convention. |
| `Ferrocast` | Planning              | Rust PowerShell rewrite (16-crate workspace)                   |
| `Craton`    | Reserved              | Rust universal package manager — codename registered; no work started yet. |
| `Ironway`   | Active                | Rust OpenTTD rewrite                                           |
| `Caliper`   | Active                | Rust raster-to-vector tracing engine (CLI+TUI)                 |
| `Mawaqit`   | Planning (**Pending rename**) | Islamic prayer times app (Flutter + Rust CLI + libmawaqit). To be renamed under the v1.2 aerospace/sci-fi/AI convention. |
| `Anvil`     | Completed             | Rust workspace; benches and CHANGELOG; legacy forging-tool name.                |
| `Flux`      | Completed             | Rust workspace; CHANGELOG and deny.toml; legacy metallurgical-flux name.        |
| `Pearlite`  | Active                | Rust workspace; audit.toml, clippy.toml, CHANGELOG; steel microstructure name.  |
| `Ferrite_OS`| Active                | Custom OS / DOS-emulation experiments; ferrite (iron-based material) name.      |
| `Forge`     | Active                | Production flavor tooling (forge-cli, forge-build, forge-activate); forging-tool name. |

Existing legacy-named projects MAY be renamed under the v1.2 convention at the maintainer's discretion — renames are optional. When a rename happens, update this table and §13.1's subdomain table in the same commit.

### §2.2 — Skill IDs are functional, not codenamed

Skill directory names and `SKILL.md` `name` fields are **functional identifiers** (e.g., `spacecraft-standard`, `spacecraft-document-format`) and are not subject to the §2 codename convention. §2 reserves codenames for projects/modules/utilities/releases, not for skill identifiers.

---

## §3 — Priority Hierarchy (Non-Negotiable Order)

A higher-numbered priority **may never compromise** a lower-numbered one.

### §3.1 — Priority 1: Stability

Software must behave predictably and remain correct under sustained and adverse conditions. Stability is the foremost priority. **Memory safety is the single most important contributor to stability and the primary means of achieving it — but it is not the whole of Priority 1.**

**Memory safety (primary lever):**

- **Preferred language: Rust** — governed by the Spacecraft Software Rust Guidelines. Always load the `rust-guidelines` skill before writing any Rust code.
- When Rust is not viable (Flutter/Dart, Zig, etc.), **mandatory mitigations**:
    - **ASLR** (Address Space Layout Randomization) on all compiled binaries
    - **CFI** (Control-Flow Integrity) wherever the toolchain supports it
- Memory-Safe Languages (MSLs) are always preferred. If an MSL alternative exists, it must be chosen unless a documented technical exemption is filed.

**Beyond memory safety, stability also requires:**

- **Robust error handling** — failures must be surfaced and handled, never silently swallowed; no panics / `unwrap` / `expect` on untrusted or fallible input in production paths.
- **Fault tolerance and graceful degradation** — components must survive partial failure, degrade gracefully under load or dependency loss, and recover rather than crash.
- **Verified by testing** — stability properties must be backed by tests (unit, integration, and fuzz/property where applicable) gating CI, not asserted by inspection alone.

### §3.2 — Priority 2: Performance

Performance is the foremost priority after stability. The default means of achieving it is **multi-core, multi-thread concurrency** — parallelism is the expected baseline, not an afterthought — *unless* concurrency would materially degrade performance (synchronization overhead, lock contention, or inherently serial / small workloads outweighing the gains), in which case a simpler or serial approach must be chosen and the trade-off documented.

- Concurrency must be **designed-in from the start**, never bolted on retroactively.
- Release builds should use CPU-optimized flags — `-march=native`, LTO, PGO — **where the toolchain and target support them reliably.** Any such flag known to break or destabilize builds on a given platform, toolchain, or linker configuration (e.g., LTO under certain NixOS, cross-compilation, or static-linking setups) MUST be disabled and the reason documented. Stability (Priority 1) outranks Performance (Priority 2), so a build-breaking or instability-inducing optimization always yields — never ship a broken build for the sake of a flag.
- Benchmarking is **mandatory** before and after any optimization work; regressions must be documented and justified — and it is the evidence by which the concurrency-vs-serial trade-off above is decided.

### §3.3 — Priority 3: Hardened Security

- Kernel hardening (XanMod, grsecurity profiles) where applicable.
- Sandboxing and privilege separation for all network-facing components.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) readiness:** all crypto subsystems must support PQC migration paths. Use hybrid schemes (classical + PQC candidate) where library support exists. Adopt NIST-finalized PQC standards within one major release cycle.
    - Current targets: **ML-KEM-768**, **ML-DSA-65** (as used in Ferrocast)
- Dependency auditing: `cargo-audit` or equivalent before any third-party crate inclusion.

**Cardinal Rule:** Any optimization that weakens **stability (including memory safety)** or security hardening **must be rejected**, no exceptions.

---

## §4 — Licensing & Compliance

### §4.1 — Project License (GPL-3.0-or-later or AGPL-3.0-or-later)

- **License:** strong copyleft — each project chooses **`GPL-3.0-or-later`** or **`AGPL-3.0-or-later`**, whichever fits the project better:
    - Use **`AGPL-3.0-or-later`** when the software is **network-facing** — anything users interact with primarily over a network (servers, web services, SaaS, hosted APIs, multiplayer/network daemons). AGPL closes the "SaaS loophole" by extending the source-availability obligation to users served over a network.
    - Use **`GPL-3.0-or-later`** for everything else (local CLIs, libraries, desktop/TUI apps, OS components, bootloaders).
    - GPLv3 and AGPLv3 are mutually compatible by design, so an umbrella mixing both is fine.
- No proprietary, closed-source, or permissive-only license for core project code.
- **Prospective, no forced re-license.** This dual choice applies going forward. Existing `GPL-3.0-or-later` projects are **not** required to migrate to AGPL even if network-facing; a maintainer MAY switch at their discretion. (Mirrors §2's prospective-naming stance — no forced back-rename.)

### §4.2 — Upstream License Compliance (preserve what you build on)

When a project incorporates, adapts, or links third-party code, it MUST satisfy that upstream's license in full — independent of the project's own GPL/AGPL choice:

- **Preserve verbatim** all upstream copyright notices, license texts, `NOTICE`/`AUTHORS` files, and in-file license headers — never strip, rewrite, or relicense them.
- **Ship** each distinct upstream license text in the project's `LICENSES/` directory (§4.3).
- **Verify compatibility** of the upstream license with the project's GPL/AGPL license before inclusion.
- This is the legal/mechanical obligation; §13.3's `CREDITS.md` is the human-readable narrative counterpart. When both are triggered, both apply.

### §4.3 — SPDX & REUSE Compliance

Spacecraft Software follows the **[REUSE specification](https://reuse.software)** for unambiguous, machine-readable license and copyright metadata. Every project MUST be `reuse lint`-clean.

**Every file carries two SPDX tags** — copyright *and* license:

```
// SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Mohamed Hammad <Mohamed.Hammad@SpacecraftSoftware.org>
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
```

(Substitute the project's actual license — `GPL-3.0-or-later` or `AGPL-3.0-or-later` — and the correct comment syntax for the file type.)

- **Software source files** (`.rs`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, `.sh`, `.ps1`, `.go`, etc.) and project manifests (`Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `flake.nix`, etc.) carry both tags as an inline header.
- **Files that cannot carry an inline header** — documents (`.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.pdf`, …), images, binary assets, generated files — are covered by a `.license` sidecar file **or** an entry in the repo-root `REUSE.toml`. No file is left uncovered (this replaces the former blanket "documents are exempt" rule).
- **`LICENSES/` directory:** the verbatim text of every license used in the repo lives in `LICENSES/<SPDX-id>.txt` (e.g., `LICENSES/GPL-3.0-or-later.txt`, `LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-or-later.txt`, plus any upstream licenses per §4.2). A root `LICENSE` file MAY remain as a pointer for GitHub's license detection.
- **CI gate:** `reuse lint` MUST pass before shipping.

When writing or reviewing any file, confirm REUSE coverage; when generating a new file, add the two-tag header (or the `.license` sidecar / `REUSE.toml` entry for files that can't carry one).

---

## §5 — Project Posture

Spacecraft Software is a personal hobby project. This posture is the **default** for every project under the umbrella and is non-negotiable. Individual projects may adopt a more open posture (see §5.3) but never a more closed one.

§4 defines the formal license; this section defines the **stated stance** that sits alongside it. License says what the user *may* do; posture says what they should *expect* from the maintainer.

### §5.1 — Default Posture (Personal / Hobby)

| Aspect         | Default                                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Audience       | Maintainer's own use case                                      |
| Pace           | Hobby pace; no service-level commitments                       |
| Warranty       | None — provided AS IS                                          |
| Liability      | None — see project `NOTICE.md`                                 |
| Contributions  | Welcome but not guaranteed to be accepted                      |
| Forking        | Encouraged                                                     |
| License        | GPL-3.0-or-later or AGPL-3.0-or-later, per §4.1 (formal terms govern in any conflict) |

### §5.2 — Required Posture Files (per project)

Every Spacecraft Software project repository **must** ship the following files at its root, derived from the canonical Spacecraft Software templates:

| File              | Purpose                                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md`       | Includes a "Project Posture" section linking to the two below |
| `NOTICE.md`       | Full no-warranty / no-liability statement; defers to the project's GPL/AGPL license (§4.1) for binding terms |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution scope, PR-acceptance discretion, sign-off, security reporting, license-of-contributions |
| `LICENSES/`       | REUSE license directory (§4.3): verbatim text of every license used (`GPL-3.0-or-later` or `AGPL-3.0-or-later`, plus any upstream licenses per §4.2). A root `LICENSE` MAY remain as a GitHub-detection pointer. |

Customize only the project name, scope, and any project-specific carve-outs.

### §5.3 — General-Use Carve-Out

A project may declare itself **intended for general use**. When it does:

- The declaration MUST appear in that project's `README.md` posture section.
- The no-warranty / no-liability stance from §5.1 still applies in full — general-use status changes audience and intent, **not** legal terms.
- General-use projects must hold a higher release-quality bar: semantic versioning, maintained `CHANGELOG.md`, deprecation policy, and a documented support window for the current major version.

**General-use registry** (keep in sync with §13.1 subdomain table):

| Project      | Posture       |
|--------------|---------------|
| Anvil-SSH    | General-use   |
| (all others) | Personal      |

### §5.4 — Maintainer Discretion

PR acceptance, feature scope, naming, architecture, and roadmap are at the maintainer's sole discretion. This is stated openly so contributors can calibrate effort accordingly. Rejection reflects fit, not quality.

---

## §6 — Platform & Systems Requirements

### §6.1 — POSIX Compliance

All CLI tools, daemons, and system utilities must be **POSIX-compliant**. Platform-specific extensions go behind feature flags and must not be required for core functionality.

### §6.2 — Post-Quantum Cryptography

Crypto subsystems must have migration paths to post-quantum algorithms. Current implementations should use hybrid schemes where library support exists.

### §6.3 — Signed & Verified Commits (Non-Negotiable)

Every commit pushed to a Spacecraft Software-controlled Git remote **must** be cryptographically signed and show "Verified" on the hosting platform's commit/PR view (GitHub today; Gitway or any future Spacecraft Software host inherits the same rule).

**Mandatory rules — violation blocks shipping:**

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| All commits signed | `commit.gpgsign=true` configured globally. SSH signing (`gpg.format=ssh`) is the current default; GPG is acceptable. The signing key MUST be registered as a **Signing** key on the hosting platform — Authentication-only keys do not validate signatures. |
| Authorized signing identity | All commits from v1.12 onwards must be signed with the `Mohamed.Hammad@SpacecraftSoftware.org` key. The committer email and the signing key identity must both resolve to `Mohamed.Hammad@SpacecraftSoftware.org`. Commits predating v1.12 are exempt from this requirement. |
| Hosting-platform "Verified" required | Every commit on a Spacecraft Software remote must show "Verified" on the platform's commit/PR view. Unsigned or "Unverified" commits MUST be remediated (re-signed via rebase or amend by the original author) before merge to a default branch. |
| Programmatic commits signed too | Bots, CI pipelines, scripted commits, and assistant-driven commits inherit the same rule — no `--no-gpg-sign`, no signing-disabled subshells. The signing pipeline runs unattended. |
| Rewrites preserve signatures | Rebase, amend, cherry-pick, and squash MUST re-sign each resulting commit. Don't push history that lost signatures through rewriting. |
| Local verification is best-effort | `git log --show-signature` may report "No signature" on a given host when `~/.ssh/allowed_signers` is not populated — this is a local-verifier gap, not a signing failure. The hosting platform's "Verified" badge is authoritative. |

**Algorithm note:** Ed25519 SSH signing is the current default. §6.2 calls for PQC readiness across the cryptographic surface; commit-signing algorithm migration is gated on hosting-platform support for post-quantum key formats. When GitHub (or Spacecraft Software's own Gitway) accepts PQC signing keys, Spacecraft Software commits migrate accordingly.

## §7 — Privacy-Friendly Application (PFA) Policy

Every Spacecraft Software application must satisfy **all three** PFA requirements:

| Requirement        | Rule                                                                     |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No Tracking/No Ads | Zero advertising, tracking, analytics SDKs, or telemetry beacons         |
| Minimal Permissions| Only essential permissions; requested lazily at point of use, never eagerly |
| Local Storage      | User data stored locally by default; sync is strictly opt-in, E2E encrypted |

When reviewing or designing any feature that touches data handling, permissions, or networking, verify all three PFA requirements are met.

---

## §8 — Key Bindings

All interactive applications must support **both**:

| Scheme    | Requirement                                                              |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CUA**   | Standard bindings (Ctrl+C/X/V/Z/S) must work in all text input contexts  |
| **Vim**   | Modal editing layer (Normal / Insert / Visual mode) as opt-in feature. Minimum: hjkl navigation where full Vim layer is impractical |

---

## §9 — Spacecraft Software Color Palette (WCAG-Compliant)

The **only** permitted colors for Spacecraft Software interfaces and documents:

| Token          | Hex       | RGB              | Role                          |
|----------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Void Navy      | `#000027` | RGB(0, 0, 39)    | **Background / Canvas**       |
| Molten Amber   | `#D98E32` | RGB(217, 142, 50)| Primary Text / Active Readout |
| Steel Blue     | `#4B7EB0` | RGB(75, 126, 176)| Primary Accent / Structural   |
| Radium Green   | `#50FA7B` | RGB(80, 250, 123)| Success / Safe Status         |
| Red Oxide      | `#FF5C5C` | RGB(255, 92, 92) | Warning / Error Status        |
| Liquid Coolant | `#8BE9FD` | RGB(139, 233, 253)| Info / Links                 |

**`#000027` (Void Navy) is the mandatory background for ALL Spacecraft Software surfaces.** No alternative background is permitted. This is non-negotiable.

For document/file generation → load the `spacecraft-document-format` skill. For IDE/terminal themes → load the `spacecraft-theme-factory` skill.

### §9.1 — Steelbore Theme (Application Theming Standard)

When building a new Spacecraft Software application (GUI, TUI, or web), all palette
references **must** be accessed through a named theme called **`Steelbore`** rather than
referenced as bare hex literals. The `Steelbore` theme is the canonical color contract:

| Theme token  | Maps to palette token | Hex       |
|--------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| `background` | Void Navy             | `#000027` |
| `foreground` | Molten Amber          | `#D98E32` |
| `accent`     | Steel Blue            | `#4B7EB0` |
| `success`    | Radium Green          | `#50FA7B` |
| `error`      | Red Oxide             | `#FF5C5C` |
| `info`       | Liquid Coolant        | `#8BE9FD` |

**Rationale:** isolating palette references behind the `Steelbore` theme name makes it trivial for end users to substitute a custom theme without touching application logic — swap the theme, not every hex literal.

- The theme file/module **must** be named `steelbore` (snake_case) in the project's theme registry, configuration layer, or equivalent (e.g., `themes/steelbore.json`, `steelbore.toml`, a Rust `Theme::Steelbore` variant).
- Hard-coding palette hex values directly in UI logic is **forbidden** for new apps. Use theme tokens exclusively.
- Existing apps are encouraged but not required to migrate; new apps are required.

---

## §10 — Typography (FOSS-Licensed Fonts Only)

Acceptable font licenses: **OFL, Apache 2.0, Ubuntu Font License, CC0-1.0**

| Context        | Font              | License |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Headings       | Share Tech Mono   | OFL     |
| Body / Code    | Inconsolata       | OFL     |
| Fallback       | monospace (system)| N/A     |

Never use proprietary fonts. When suggesting or using fonts in any Spacecraft Software artifact, verify they are available on Google Fonts or another FOSS-licensed repository.

---

## §11 — UI/UX Design System

- **Material Design** is the required component system for all graphical applications. Theme Material components with the §9 color palette.
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** contrast is the minimum for all color pairings. Any new color additions must be WCAG-verified before adoption.
- **Accessibility:** screen readers, keyboard-only navigation, and system accessibility preferences (reduced motion, high contrast) must all be respected.

---

## §12 — Date, Time & Units

### §12.1 — Date & Time Format Rules

| Concern      | Rule                                                             | Example                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Date format  | ISO 8601 only: `YYYY-MM-DD`                                      | `2026-03-08`                 |
| Time format  | 24-hour only: `HH:MM:SS` — AM/PM is **never** permitted          | `14:30:00`                   |
| Timestamp    | Combined ISO 8601 UTC: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`                    | `2026-03-08T14:30:00Z`       |
| Timezone     | **UTC Z is the default and preferred primary** for general-purpose, cross-system, and machine-readable timestamps. A project whose core domain is inherently local-time-bound (e.g., solar/prayer-time calculations) may declare local time as its primary record instead — a documented exception, not a free choice. See §12.2 and §12.2.1 | `Z` not `+00:00`             |
| Duration     | ISO 8601 duration format only                                    | `PT1H30M` not "1h 30m"       |
| Units        | Metric (SI) primary; imperial in parentheses only if locale requires | `100 km (62 mi)`         |

Apply these conventions to all generated code, documentation, comments, and any user-facing strings. Never output AM/PM time, non-ISO dates, or imperial-primary units.

### §12.2 — UTC Z Timezone Policy

**UTC Z is the default and preferred timezone for stored, transmitted, logged, and committed timestamps across Spacecraft Software projects.** It is the convention every project should reach for first — it keeps cross-project tooling, sorting, and interchange simple and unambiguous. Under this default, the `Z` suffix is required on primary timestamps, and local time expressed as a UTC offset (e.g., `2026-05-24T13:34:55+03:00`) may optionally accompany a UTC Z value as a secondary, human-convenience field — but UTC Z remains the authoritative record.

This is a strong default, not a universal mandate forced onto every domain regardless of fit — §12.2.1 documents the exception that lets a project whose domain is genuinely local-time-bound use local time as its primary record instead.

**Rules for projects under the UTC Z default — apply unless a project has filed the §12.2.1 exception:**

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| `Z` suffix required | Every **primary** stored/transmitted timestamp MUST end with `Z`. `2026-03-08T14:30:00Z` ✓. A companion local-time field with UTC offset is permitted alongside it. |
| No offset notation as replacement | Offset notation (`+03:00`, `-05:00`, etc.) is **forbidden as a replacement** for UTC Z. It is permitted only as an optional companion field alongside a `Z`-suffixed primary. |
| No bare local time in data | Local-time timestamps **without** timezone info are **forbidden** in files, databases, logs, API responses, and commits. |
| Log entries use UTC + `Z` | Every log line timestamp must be `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ` (millisecond precision encouraged). |
| Commit timestamps use UTC | `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` and `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` must be UTC when set programmatically. |
| File metadata written by Spacecraft Software tools | mtime/ctime written by Spacecraft Software tools must be UTC-sourced. |

### §12.2.1 — Domain Exception: Inherently Local-Time-Bound Projects

A project whose core domain is fundamentally defined by **local civil or solar time** — not by a moment in absolute (UTC) time — may declare local time as the **primary** representation for that domain's data. Examples: prayer-time calculations (`Mawaqit`), sunrise/sunset tables, local event or business-hours scheduling. For data like this, the meaningful value *is* "06:14 local, at this place" — collapsing it to a UTC instant first and treating that as authoritative would misrepresent what the data actually is.

**Conditions for the exception:**

1. **Document it.** The project's README or spec must state explicitly which data uses local time as primary, and the *domain* reason why — not developer or user convenience.
2. **Keep the default everywhere else.** General-purpose machinery within the same project — logs, commit timestamps, internal cross-system APIs, telemetry — still follows the §12.2 UTC Z default. The exception covers the domain data itself, not the whole project.
3. **Preserve UTC derivability.** Store or compute the IANA timezone (e.g., `Africa/Cairo`) alongside the local value, so a UTC instant remains derivable for interchange, comparison, and storage portability.
4. **This is an exception, not an escape hatch.** "Local time is more convenient" or "our users are mostly in one timezone" do not qualify — the domain itself must be inherently local-time-bound.

### §12.3 — Local Time as Optional Companion

**For projects under the UTC Z default** (§12.2), local time expressed as a UTC offset is permitted as an **optional companion** to the UTC Z primary value — in human-facing display, in API responses (as an additional field, never replacing the UTC Z field), and in stored records where timezone context aids human readers. The UTC Z value is always present and always authoritative; the local-time companion is supplemental only. (A project operating under the §12.2.1 domain exception inverts these roles for its domain data — local time is primary there, with UTC kept derivable rather than displayed as authoritative.)

- The `--absolute-time` flag (defined in `spacecraft-cli-standard` §3) disables relative-time rendering but always renders as UTC, not local time.
- If a future CLI wants to show local time in human mode, it MUST:
    1. Accept a `--tz <IANA-zone>` flag (e.g., `--tz Africa/Cairo`).
    2. Render local time only to stdout in human mode — never in `--json` output.
    3. Always include the UTC value alongside the local rendering.
    4. Never persist or transmit the local-time rendering.
- JSON/machine output (`--format json/jsonl/yaml/csv`) MUST always use UTC + `Z`.

### §12.4 — Duration Format

Durations follow ISO 8601 duration notation:

| Format     | Example   | Meaning             |
|------------|-----------|---------------------|
| `PTnHnMnS` | `PT1H30M` | 1 hour 30 minutes   |
| `PnD`      | `P7D`     | 7 days              |
| `PnYnM`    | `P1Y6M`   | 1 year 6 months     |

Prose forms like "1h 30m", "90 minutes", "1.5 hours" are **forbidden** in machine-readable output. They are acceptable in `--help` text only.

### §12.5 — Rust Implementation Guidance

When writing Rust code that handles time:

| Concern | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Crate choice | Use `jiff` (preferred) or `chrono` — never `time` 0.1.x |
| UTC type | `jiff::Timestamp` or `chrono::DateTime<chrono::Utc>` for all stored values |
| Local type | `chrono::Local` and `jiff::Zoned` (with non-UTC zone) are **forbidden** in serialized output |
| Serialization | Always serialize as `"2026-03-08T14:30:00Z"` (string, ISO 8601, `Z` suffix) |
| `serde` | Use `#[serde(with = "...")]` or a newtype that enforces UTC on deserialization |
| `SystemTime` | Acceptable for internal durations; convert to UTC ISO 8601 string before any output |
| No `NaiveDateTime` in output | `chrono::NaiveDateTime` has no timezone — forbidden in any serialized or logged value |

### §13.2 — Mandatory Attribution in Project Outputs

Every Spacecraft Software product **must** surface the following attribution in at least one of: `--help` output, `--version` output, README, or About/Info screen.

**Required attribution block:**

```

(The License line shows the project's own license — GPL-3.0-or-later or AGPL-3.0-or-later per §4.1.)
```

**Per-surface rules:**

| Surface           | Required content                                                                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--version`       | Maintainer name, project URL, copyright year                                      |
| `--help`          | Project URL and maintainer name (at footer)                                       |
| README            | "Maintainer" section: name, `Mohamed.Hammad@SpacecraftSoftware.org`, project URL  |
| About / Info (GUI/TUI) | Maintainer name, project URL, copyright year                                 |
| SPDX header       | REUSE two-tag header (§4.3): `SPDX-FileCopyrightText` + `SPDX-License-Identifier` (`GPL-3.0-or-later` or `AGPL-3.0-or-later`) |

**Specific rules:**

- The contact email is always `Mohamed.Hammad@SpacecraftSoftware.org` — never a personal domain, GitHub handle, or other address.
- The copyright year reflects the year of first release or current year, or a range (e.g., `2025-2026`) when a project spans multiple years.
- Link text for project pages must use the full URL as the display text or a clear label (e.g., `[Gitway](https://Gitway.SpacecraftSoftware.org/)`), never an opaque label.
- For CLI `--version` output in human mode, the footer line format is:

    ```
    Maintained by Mohamed Hammad <Mohamed.Hammad@SpacecraftSoftware.org>
    https://<ProjectName>.SpacecraftSoftware.org/
    ```

- For CLI `--version` output in JSON/machine mode, include in `metadata`:

    ```json
    "maintainer": "Mohamed Hammad <Mohamed.Hammad@SpacecraftSoftware.org>",
    "website": "https://<ProjectName>.SpacecraftSoftware.org/"
    ```

### §13.3 — Third-Party Attribution

Spacecraft Software artifacts must give credit where credit is due. When a project or skill **substantially builds on third-party work**, that credit appears in a `CREDITS.md` at the artifact's root — `<project-root>/CREDITS.md` for projects, `<skill-name>/CREDITS.md` for skills.

`CREDITS.md` is the inbound counterpart to §13.2's outbound attribution: §13.2 tells consumers who maintains Spacecraft Software; §13.3 tells consumers whose work Spacecraft Software stands on.

**Triggers** (any one obligates a `CREDITS.md`):

- Content adapted, derived, or copied verbatim from an external source under any license (permissive or copyleft).
- A library, framework, or specification whose ideas or implementation form a substantial conceptual basis for the artifact, beyond routine dependency use.
- Named prior art, research, or design work whose insights were borrowed.

**Not triggered by** (license metadata alone suffices):

- Routine package-manager dependencies whose `LICENSE` files are surfaced mechanically via Cargo, npm, pip, Nix, etc.
- Well-known standards and specifications (POSIX, RFC, ISO, GFM, ODF, OOXML) that the artifact conforms to but does not redistribute.
- Public-domain conventions and common idioms.

**Required content per credited work:**

| Field      | Required | Example                                          |
|------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Name       | Yes      | `Microsoft Pragmatic Rust Guidelines`            |
| Author(s)  | Yes      | `Microsoft Corporation`                          |
| License    | Yes      | `MIT License`                                    |
| Source URL | Yes      | `https://github.com/microsoft/rust-guidelines`   |
| Scope      | Yes      | One-line description of what was adapted/used    |

A skill MAY keep a deeper, scope-limited attribution file inside its `references/` directory (typically `references/ATTRIBUTION.md`) when the credit applies specifically to adapted reference content. The root `CREDITS.md` remains canonical and should link down to any such deeper file.

SPDX headers (§4) cover license compliance mechanically; `CREDITS.md` is the human-readable narrative — who, what, and how the upstream work shaped the Spacecraft Software artifact.
